This is the demo app I wrote to demonstrate some of my skills for a job interviews.

This app allows users to:
- sign up and sign in to application
- upload videos in any format FFMpeg can handle
- watch the upload progress (useful for big files)
- see a video thumbnail as soon as upload finish
- set some title and description for the video
- watch the video conversion progress: queued, converting, ready
- comment the videos published
- reply to other's comments, so the comments are nested

ps. video conversion is done as background process(es) using Resque gem (background jobs queue/processor)

That's all. Try it!
